## Overview

### Origin Story

The Bitcoin Bitte Agent was initially developed during the One Trillion Agents Hackathon to enable Bitcoin testnet transactions using NEAR accounts. It allowed users to retrieve their NEAR account, corresponding BTC Testnet address, and balance, and seamlessly create and send Bitcoin transactions.

In v2.0, we are adding trading capabilities in this agent that will allow users to buy, sell and swap any assets on any chain to BTC and vice versa.

### What is Bitcoin Agent?

"Bitcoin Agent", an agent that uses NEAR chain signatures to interact with Bitcoin L1.
Now, you can send transactions on the Bitcoin mainnet using just your NEAR account. The agent‚Äôs tools are highly composable and can be integrated with other agents to create MPC transactions and broadcast them on the Bitcoin mainnet.

### Features of Bitcoin Agent

‚û°Ô∏è MPC Bitcoin Wallet : The agent runs in the Bitte runtime, powered by NEAR chain signatures and NEAR Intents for . When you sign and send transactions on the Bitcoin mainnet, there are no bridges and no wrapped tokens involved. Transaction are settled directly on Bitcoin L1.

‚û°Ô∏è Agent Dashboard : You can access the Bitcoin Agent dashboard [here](http://bitcoin-agent.xyz/dashboard) to get your Bitcoin address associated with your NEAR account. The dashboard also displays your agent status, wallet balances, and past transactions.

‚û°Ô∏è Instant Swaps : The agent allows users to access unified, chain abstracted liquidity to buy BTC with any asset they have in any wallet. Just deposit, swap and withdraw BTC to any wallet using NEAR intents.

## Agent Tools

- This agent is built using bitte-ai/agent-sdk to standardize agent behavior and communication. Implemented tools are as follows:

  - `get-user` : Get NEAR wallet context

  - `get-btc-balance` : Fetch user‚Äôs BTC balance

  - `create-btc-mpc-transaction` : Generate a Bitcoin transaction using MPC signing

  - `send-btc-txn` : Broadcast a signed transaction to Bitcoin mainnet

  - `check-supported-token` : Checks if asset is supported for swap to BTC through NEAR intents on NEAR blockchain.

  - `swap-to-bitcoin` : Swap any deposited asset to bitcoin using NEAR intents and withdraw to your MPC bitcoin wallet.

- Each tool is registered in the AI plugin manifest at : `/api/ai-plugin`
