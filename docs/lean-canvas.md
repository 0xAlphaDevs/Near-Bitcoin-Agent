# Lean Canvas for Bitcoin Agent

An agent that uses **NEAR chain signatures** and **intents** to interact with **Bitcoin L1**, enabling native transactions, swaps, and integrations with the broader NEAR ecosystem.

## 1. Problem

Top 3 problems we're solving:

- Sending Bitcoin directly from Web3 wallets is difficult, no seamless UX between Bitcoin L1 and smart contract platforms.
- Existing solutions rely on bridges or wrapped BTC, which introduce custodial risk and complexity.
- No simple agent-based experience that connects AI/intent-driven flows with native Bitcoin transactions.

Existing alternatives:

- Centralized exchanges (CEXs) enabling BTC withdrawals.
- Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC, tBTC) on Ethereum or other chains.
- Custodial wallets with limited programmability.
- Emerging Bitcoin Layer 2s (Lightning, Stacks), but fragmented and not composable with NEAR.

## 2. Customer Segments

- Web3 users who want to interact with Bitcoin without bridges.
- Developers building apps that need Bitcoin payments but don’t want custody headaches.
- NEAR ecosystem users leveraging NEAR accounts for multi-chain access.

Early adopters:

- Hackathon builders and AI agent developers experimenting with NEAR + Bitcoin.
- NEAR community.
- Web3 users already familiar with multi-chain DeFi.

## 3. Unique Value Proposition

> **“Bitcoin Agent enables anyone to send, trade, and swap native Bitcoin directly from their NEAR account — no bridges, no wrapped tokens, just seamless cross-chain access.”**

### High-level concept:

**NEAR accounts as a gateway to Bitcoin L1.**

## 4. Solution

Problem: Sending Bitcoin directly from Web3 wallets is difficult.
</br  >
Solution: Bitcoin Agent allows users to send native Bitcoin using their existing NEAR account, with no extra wallets or setup required.

Problem: Current alternatives rely on wrapped BTC or bridges, introducing risks.</br  >
Solution: Transactions are signed with NEAR-based MPC and executed on Bitcoin L1, removing the need for wrapped tokens or custodians.

Problem: No simple way to connect AI/intent systems with Bitcoin.</br  >
Solution: Bitcoin Agent plugs into the Bitte AI agent SDK and exposes a clean plugin manifest (/api/ai-plugin), enabling agents and developers to trigger real Bitcoin transactions via simple intents.

## 5. Channels

NEAR Ecosystem Channels: Leverage NEAR cohorts, and community forums to onboard early developers and users.

Bitte AI Playground: Showcase and test Bitcoin Agent directly inside the Bitte Playground, where developers are already experimenting with agents.

Content & Thought Leadership: Share blog posts, demos, and Twitter/X threads on the future of intent-driven Bitcoin transactions.

## 6. Revenue Streams

- Transaction/service fees on Bitcoin MPC transactions.
- Premium APIs for developers (higher limits, analytics, custom agents).

## 7. Cost Structure

**Fixed costs:**

- Core development & maintenance.
- MPC server infrastructure.
- Security audits (Bitcoin + NEAR + MPC).

**Variable costs:**

- Marketing/community incentives.
- NEAR gas fees & BTC network fees.
- Scaling infrastructure for Axons network.

## 8. Key Metrics

Key activities we measure:

- Daily/Monthly Active Users (DAU/MAU).
- Number of Bitcoin transactions executed via NEAR accounts.
- Community engagement ( GitHub stars).

## 9. Unfair Advantage

- First-mover advantage of connecting NEAR MPC with Bitcoin L1.
- Deep integration with AI agent ecosystem (Bitte AI).
- Strategic positioning within NEAR ecosystem and cohorts.

## 10. Blockchain/AI Integration

- **Blockchain:** NEAR provides decentralized accounts, MPC ensures non-custodial Bitcoin signing.
- **AI Agents:** Intent-driven UX enables natural, automated Bitcoin interactions.
- **Data sovereignty:** Users keep custody of keys while still accessing Bitcoin.

## 11. Regulatory Considerations

- Focus on non-custodial architecture (reduces regulatory overhead).
- Compliance with data privacy and AI transparency regulations.
